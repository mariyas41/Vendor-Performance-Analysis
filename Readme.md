### 🔍 Project Overview
The dataset includes **sales, purchase, and stock details** for multiple brands and vendors.  
The aim was to:
- Identify **top-performing vendors and brands**  
- Highlight **underperforming brands** needing marketing or stock adjustment  
- Track **profit, sales, and unsold inventory** trends over time  

---

### 🧩 Key Analytical Steps

1. **Data Extraction (BigQuery)**
   - Queried transactional data (Sales, Purchase, Inventory)  
   - Joined and aggregated across Vendor, Brand, and Category tables  

2. **Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)**
   - Handled missing purchase prices and negative profit anomalies  
   - Verified SKU-level consistency  
   - Generated summary statistics for margin, stock, and turnover rate  

3. **Data Modeling (Power BI)**
   - Created star schema linking Vendor, Brand, and Date dimensions  
   - Calculated DAX metrics:
     - `Total Purchase` = SUM(Purchase[Amount])  
     - `Total Sales` = SUM(Sales[Amount])  
     - `Profit` = [Total Sales] - [Total Purchase]  
     - `Margin %` = DIVIDE([Profit], [Total Sales])  
     - `Unsold Capital` = Stock[Qty] * Purchase[Unit Cost]  

4. **Visualization**
   - Sales vs. Profit comparison by Vendor  
   - Top 10 Brands by Revenue  
   - Vendor contribution share  
   - Unsold Stock trend over time  
   - Profit margin analysis by brand

### 💡 Insights

| Observation | Insight | Business Impact |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| Vendor performance highly skewed | Top 10 vendors contribute ~65% of total purchase | Focus on vendor relationship management and discount leverage |
| Profit margin inconsistency | Some brands show negative margins despite high sales | Indicates over-purchasing or pricing inefficiency |
| Unsold capital value significant | High unsold inventory value across some vendors | Indicates over-purchasing or stock allocation mismatch |
| Low-performing brands | Identified via DAX threshold filters | Recommend targeted marketing or vendor negotiation |

---

### 🧠 Recommendations
- **Optimize Procurement:** Negotiate with high-volume vendors for better discounts.  
- **Control Overbuying:** Monitor unsold stock and tie reorder quantity to historical demand.  
- **Promote Weak Brands:** Run targeted campaigns for low-margin but high-stock brands.  
- **Automate Alerts:** Build Power BI KPI thresholds to flag vendors below target margins.

---

### 🚀 Outcomes
✅ Improved visibility into vendor-wise profitability and contribution.  
✅ Identified brands for potential promotion or delisting.
